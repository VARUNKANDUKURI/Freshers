1. What is a Computer Network?

A Computer Network is a collection of interconnected devices (computers, servers, routers) that communicate and 
share resources over wired or wireless connections.

Examples:
	•	Local Area Network (LAN) – Office network, home Wi-Fi.
	•	Wide Area Network (WAN) – The Internet.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. What are the types of computer networks?
	1.	LAN (Local Area Network) – Covers a small area like a home, office.
	2.	WAN (Wide Area Network) – Covers large areas, like cities or countries (e.g., the Internet).
	3.	MAN (Metropolitan Area Network) – Covers a city (e.g., cable TV networks).
	4.	PAN (Personal Area Network) – Smallest network, like Bluetooth connections.
	5.	VPN (Virtual Private Network) – Secure private network over the Internet.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. What is the OSI Model? Name its layers.

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model is a conceptual framework that standardizes network communication in seven layers:
	1.	Physical Layer – Deals with hardware, cables, signals.
	2.	Data Link Layer – Ensures error-free data transfer (MAC, Ethernet).
	3.	Network Layer – Handles IP addressing, routing (Routers, IPv4/IPv6).
	4.	Transport Layer – Manages end-to-end communication (TCP, UDP).
	5.	Session Layer – Manages sessions and connections between applications.
	6.	Presentation Layer – Encrypts and formats data (SSL, compression).
	7.	Application Layer – Provides services like HTTP, FTP, SMTP (Browsers, Emails).
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. TCP vs UDP Ports: Key Differences

1. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
	•	Type: Connection-oriented (establishes a connection before data transfer).
	•	Reliability: Ensures accurate data delivery with acknowledgments and retransmissions.
	•	Speed: Slower due to error-checking and flow control.
	•	Use Cases: Web browsing (HTTP/HTTPS), email, file transfers.

Example TCP Ports:
	•	HTTP: Port 80
	•	HTTPS: Port 443
	•	FTP: Port 21
	
2. UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
	•	Type: Connectionless (no prior connection setup).
	•	Reliability: Unreliable; no acknowledgment or retransmission.
	•	Speed: Faster due to minimal overhead.
	•	Use Cases: Streaming, online gaming, DNS queries, VoIP.

Example UDP Ports:
	•	DNS: Port 53
	•	DHCP: Ports 67, 68
	•	RTP: Ports 5004, 5005
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


5. What is an IP Address? What are IPv4 and IPv6?

An IP Address is a unique identifier assigned to a device in a network.

IPv4 (Internet Protocol Version 4)
	•	32-bit address (e.g., 192.168.1.1).
	•	Supports 4.3 billion devices.
	•	Uses dot-decimal notation.

IPv6 (Internet Protocol Version 6)
	•	128-bit address (e.g., 2001:db8::1).
	•	Supports trillions of devices.
	•	Uses colon-separated hexadecimal notation.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. What is a MAC Address?

A MAC (Media Access Control) Address is a unique 48-bit identifier assigned to a device’s network interface card (NIC). 
It is written in hexadecimal format (e.g., 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E).
	•	Used for local network communication (LAN).
	•	Unlike IP addresses, MAC addresses do not change.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7. What is DNS and how does it work?

DNS (Domain Name System) translates domain names (e.g., google.com) into IP addresses (e.g., 142.250.190.78).

How DNS Works?
	1.	User enters www.google.com.
	2.	The browser contacts the DNS server to get the IP address.
	3.	The DNS server responds with the IP address.
	4.	The browser connects to the server using the IP address.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8. What is a Subnet Mask?

A Subnet Mask divides an IP address into a network part and a host part to improve efficiency.

Example:

For IP Address 192.168.1.10 and Subnet Mask 255.255.255.0:
	•	Network ID: 192.168.1.0
	•	Host ID: 10
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9. What are the differences between Hub, Switch, and Router?

Hub -->	Broadcasts data to all devices in a network	--> Physical Layer
Switch --> Sends data only to the intended recipient --> Data Link Layer
Router --> Connects different networks and routes traffic --> Network Layer

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

10. What is NAT (Network Address Translation)?

NAT allows multiple devices in a private network to share a single public IP address to access the Internet.

Types of NAT:
	•	Static NAT: One private IP is mapped to one public IP.
	•	Dynamic NAT: Assigns a public IP dynamically.
	•	PAT (Port Address Translation): Multiple private IPs share a single public IP using different ports.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

11. What is DHCP?

DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) automatically assigns IP addresses to devices in a network.

How DHCP Works?
	1.	The device sends a DHCP request.
	2.	The DHCP server assigns an available IP address.
	3.	The device receives an IP, subnet mask, and gateway.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

12. What is a Firewall?

A Firewall is a security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on security rules.

Types of Firewalls:
	•	Packet Filtering Firewall – Examines packets and blocks/rejects them.
	•	Stateful Firewall – Tracks the state of active connections.
	•	Proxy Firewall – Acts as an intermediary between users and the Internet.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
	
13. What is the difference between Unicast, Broadcast, and Multicast?
	•	Unicast – One sender, one receiver (e.g., one-to-one communication like a private chat).
	•	Broadcast – One sender, all receivers (e.g., ARP requests).
	•	Multicast – One sender, multiple selected receivers (e.g., live streaming).
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
14. What is ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)?

ARP maps an IP address to a MAC address in a network.

How ARP Works?
	1.	A device asks, “Who has IP 192.168.1.2?”
	2.	The target device responds with its MAC address.
	3.	The sender stores the mapping in its ARP cache.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
15. What is the difference between Circuit Switching and Packet Switching?
	•	Circuit Switching – A dedicated path is established for communication (e.g., telephone calls).
	•	Packet Switching – Data is divided into packets and transmitted separately (e.g., the Internet).
	
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
16. What is a VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network)?

A VLAN logically groups devices into different networks even if they are physically connected to the same switch.

Benefits of VLANs:
	•	Improves security.
	•	Reduces network congestion.
	•	Separates departments in an organization.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
17. What is Load Balancing?

Load Balancing distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server is overwhelmed.

Example:

A website with millions of users uses load balancers to distribute traffic among multiple web servers.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

18. What is the difference between HTTP and HTTPS?
	•	HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol): Unsecured data transmission.
	•	HTTPS (HTTP Secure): Uses SSL/TLS encryption for secure data transfer.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
	
19. What is a Proxy Server?

A Proxy Server acts as an intermediary between users and the Internet, providing security, caching, and content filtering.

Example:
	•	Forward Proxy: Used by clients to access external websites.
	•	Reverse Proxy: Used by web servers to handle client requests.
