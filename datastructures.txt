Data Structures & Algorithms

1. What is a Data Structure? and types ?

A data structure is a way of organizing, storing, and managing data efficiently. Examples include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.

Data structures are broadly classified into:
	1.	Linear Data Structures – Elements are stored sequentially.
	•	Examples: Array, Linked List, Stack, Queue
	2.	Non-Linear Data Structures – Elements are stored hierarchically.
	•	Examples: Tree, Graph, Hash Table


2. What is an array? How is it different from a linked list?

An array is a collection of elements stored at contiguous memory locations. It allows fast access using an index but has a fixed size.
 example:
 arr = [10, 20, 30, 40]
print(arr[1])  # Output: 20


A linked list is a data structure where elements (nodes) are linked using pointers, allowing dynamic memory allocation but slower access.
types:
Types:
	1.	Singly Linked List – Each node has a pointer to the next node.
	2.	Doubly Linked List – Each node has pointers to both the previous and next nodes.
	3.	Circular Linked List – The last node points to the first node.



3. Explain the difference between a stack and a queue.

A Stack is a LIFO (Last In, First Out) data structure where elements are added and removed from the same end (top).

Operations:
	•	push() – Insert element
	•	pop() – Remove element
	•	peek() – Get the top element

A Queue is a FIFO (First In, First Out) data structure where elements are inserted at the rear and removed from the front.

Operations:
	•	enqueue() – Add element
	•	dequeue() – Remove element
	
4. What is Binary tree and binary search tree (BST)?


A Binary Tree is a hierarchical structure where each node has at most two children (left and right).

Types:
	•	Full Binary Tree – Every node has 0 or 2 children.
	•	Complete Binary Tree – All levels are filled except possibly the last.
	•	Binary Search Tree (BST) – Left child < Root < Right child.


A BST is a tree data structure where:
	•	The left subtree has values less than the root.
	•	The right subtree has values greater than the root.
	•	Operations like search, insert, and delete have an average time complexity of O(log n).

Question 2: What is a hash table?
Answer: A hash table is a data structure that implements an associative array, allowing fast retrieval of values based on unique keys. It uses a hash function to map keys to indices in an array, providing constant-time average access (O(1)) if collisions are minimized.

Question 3: What is a hash function?
Answer: A hash function is a function that takes an input of any size and produces an output of a fixed size. The output is called a hash value or hash code.

Question 4: Explain how a hash function works.
Answer: A hash function takes an input key and maps it to a fixed-size index (hash value) within the hash table’s array. Ideally, the function distributes keys evenly across the array to minimize collisions. Common hash functions include modulo division, bitwise operations, and polynomial hashing.

Question 5: What is a collision?
Answer: A collision occurs when two different keys hash to the same value.

Answer:

Open addressing: Use probing techniques (linear, quadratic, double hashing) to find the next available slot when a collision occurs.
Separate chaining: Store key-value pairs in linked lists at each index, leading to better performance for larger data sets.
Question 7: How are collisions handled in a hash data structure?
Answer: Collisions can be handled using various techniques, such as chaining, open addressing, and cuckoo hashing.

Question 8: What is chaining?
Answer: Chaining is a collision resolution technique where colliding keys are stored in a linked list at the same hash value.

Question 9: What is open addressing?
Answer: Open addressing is a collision resolution technique where colliding keys are stored in the same hash table, but at different locations.

Question 10: What is separate chaining?
Answer: Separate chaining is a collision resolution technique used in hash tables. When two or more keys hash to the same index in the hash table, instead of overwriting the existing data, separate chaining stores each key-value pair in a linked list at that index. This allows for efficient retrieval of all elements that hash to the same index, even if there are collisions.

Question 11: What are the trade-offs between open addressing and separate chaining?
Answer:

Open addressing: Less memory overhead, but search performance degrades with collisions.
Separate chaining: More memory usage, but faster search performance even with collisions.

Answer: The optimal load factor for a hash table depends on the collision resolution technique used, but it is typically around 0.7.

Question 15: Explain the concept of load factor and its impact on performance.
Answer: Load factor (number of elements / size of hash table) measures how full the table is. Higher load factors increase collision frequency and impact performance. Optimal values vary based on implementation and trade-offs.

Question 16: What are the advantages of using a hash data structure?
Answer: Hash data structures offer fast lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. They are also space-efficient and can handle large datasets.

Question 17: What are the disadvantages of using a hash data structure?
Answer: Hash data structures can suffer from collisions, which can slow down lookup operations. They also require a hash function that is both efficient and effective.

Question 18: Explain bloom filters and their applications.

Question 6: When would you choose a tree over other data structures like arrays or linked lists?
Answer: Trees are ideal for hierarchical data, maintaining relationships between elements, and efficient searching based on order. Arrays or linked lists are better for simple linear data or frequent insertions/deletions at specific positions.

Question 7: Explain the concept of a binary search tree.
Answer: A binary search tree has a specific ordering property: the data in the left subtree is less than the root, and the data in the right subtree is greater than the root. This allows for efficient searching by comparing values with the root and navigating left or right accordingly.

Question 8: How do self-balancing trees like AVL or Red-Black trees work?
Answer: These trees automatically adjust their structure after insertions or deletions to maintain a balanced height, ensuring efficient search and insertion/deletion operations. They achieve this through specific rules and rotations based on node heights and colors.

Question 9: Describe the different tree traversal methods (preorder, inorder, postorder).
Answer:
Preorder: Visit root, then left subtree, then right subtree.
Inorder: Visit left subtree, then root, then right subtree.
Postorder: Visit left subtree, then right subtree, then root.
Each traversal method has different purposes. Inorder is useful for printing sorted elements in a binary search tree, while preorder might be used for copying tree structure.
